# EduVast

This Idea is all about building an application where we'll provide all kind of platforms for teachers and students. which would be the combination of various applications we already have. The list of application has given below: 

## Some applications related to the idea:

1. Google classroom
2. Blackboard
3. Ms Team
4. Udemy
5. Unacademy
6. Zoom, Google meet, etc
7. Ola, Uber, etc

## This application will have different Sections.

1. A section where teachers will take online classes, and they will give homeworks, quizes and all the necessary tasts and activities to the students. This section would be similar to google classroom, Ms team, blackboard, etc. 

2. A section where anyone can create rooms for meetings just like zoom, google meet, etc.

3.  A section where student will experience some whole new add-ons, where they'll watch video on any particular topic or subjects after subscribing like, Udemy, Unacademy and similar applications.

4. A section which is inspired by ola, uber, zomato, swiggy applications, here students can find nearby available teachers either for teaching online or offline (for online session student can search throughout India but for offline the range would be under 10-15km). Every teacher is going to have ratings based on their performance just like ola, uber drivers and swiggy zomato delivery guys are getting.

5. A section called E-library which would contain all kind of books online.


### Solutions: 

1. Teachers will get a common platform for teaching more students. it will help them to earn extra money as well
2. Schools, Institutions and even Universities can use by EduVast application to get there student a online platform for online class sessions.
3. It will save lot of time for users.
4. Users will get a single application for all their educational works and even rooms for non educational purpouse. 
5. Student will get to know about nearby teachers.

### Challenges:

1. All the teachers need to register themselves  as a teacher to get shown in the list of teachers (all over India and the nearby map).
2. The fees management. Either the teacher is charging directly or charging through the application.
3. Getting all the resources like books and videos.

### Questions:

1. From where will we get all the resources including videos and e-books. How would we collaborate with other e-libraries?
2. How to make all the teachers register to our application?
3. What could we do for those teachers who are aged and not used to off modern technologies.
